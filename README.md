# QuokkaJs-Babel

> Ready-to-tun QuokaJs with Babel project 

## How to use it

- Step 1: Install QuokkaJs extension on your editor of preference

> **DISCLAIMER**: I have only tested this project on *Visual Studio Code* but it should work just fine on any editor supported by QuokkaJs.

- Step 2: install npm packages locally

```sh
npm install
```

- Step 3: Enjoy!

New time you add new QuokkaJs file to your project (or just use dummyTest.js) all ES features will be supported.
